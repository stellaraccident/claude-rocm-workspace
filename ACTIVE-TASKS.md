# Active Tasks

This file tracks current and background tasks. Update it as you start new work or complete tasks.

## Current Focus

**None** - Update this when starting a task

<!-- Example:
**[cmake-refactor](tasks/active/cmake-refactor.md)** - Priority 1
Refactoring the CMake build system for better modularity
-->

## Background Tasks

<!-- Add tasks you're working on but not currently focused on -->

<!-- Example:
- **[ci-pipeline-perf](tasks/active/ci-pipeline-perf.md)** - Investigating CI build performance
- **[gfx942-support](tasks/active/gfx942-support.md)** - Adding support for new GPU architecture
-->

## Quick Start New Task

1. Create a new file: `tasks/active/task-name.md`
2. Copy the template from `tasks/active/example-task.md`
3. Add it to this list
4. Tell Claude: "I'm working on task-name" or use `/task task-name`

## Moving to Completed

When a task is done:
```bash
mv tasks/active/task-name.md tasks/completed/
```

Then remove it from this list.
